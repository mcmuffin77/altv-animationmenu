# altv-animationmenu

Simple Menu to select and play an animation.

You can open the menu with "T".



The script is based on the dpemotes Repository for FiveM, especially the list for all possible animations.

I haven't included all animations from dpemotes, so feel free to add some :)

I also used the NativeUI Repository for AltV
